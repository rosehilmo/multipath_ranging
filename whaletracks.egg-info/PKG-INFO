# multipath_ranging
Detection and ranging to fin whale calls recorded on ocean bottom seismometers

## Installation For Beginners:

Install [github desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) (or you can use git in the terminal if you prefer)

Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) python distribution for your operating system

Clone whaletracks to your local machine using GitHub Desktop (Click on green box on whaletracks GitHub page, then click 'open using Github Desktop') 

If using Mac or Linux:
-   Open bash terminal and navigate to whaletracks directory using "cd multipath_ranging"
-   Setup python package by running "python setup.py develop"
-   Download dependencies by running "pip install mp_ranging"

If using Windows:
-   Open Anaconda Navigator
-   Launch "CMD.exe Prompt"
-   In CMD.exe terminal, use "cd" command to navigate to whaletracks folder
-   Setup python package by running "python setup.py develop"
-   Download dependencies by running "pip install mp_ranging"

Now you should be able to open any python code in the whaletracks directory using the Spyder IDE from the Anaconda Navigator. Use Spyder to edit any code parameters. 

It is recommended that you run these codes using a terminal, NOT Spyder. Save any code edits you made from Spyder, then open either a CMD.exe (Windows) or bash (Mac, Linux) terminal. In the terminal, enter 'ipython'. This will open an instance of python in your terminal. From there, run any python codes by entering 'run code_name.py'

## Codes of interest in "whaletracks/whaletracks/detection" folder
- 'MP' codes are multitpath ranging codes tuned to detect timings of multipaths at specific OBS sites indicated in code. 

- 'plot_ranges_calltimings.py' caluclates ranges using multipath timings and bellhop-derived range vs. timing models. Bellhop models for each site are in bellhop folder.

- detect_calls.py defines functions used by multipath codes (casual users of this code will not need to edit these)
